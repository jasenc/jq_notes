# jq_notes

This is a fun little web app that I developed in order to truly explore the capabilities of jQuery, inparticularly DOM manipulation. Please note that this web app is not secure, if hosted it will be prone to probably any script injection exploit known. Perhaps one day I will continue to develop this further but in the meantime it is simply a representation of one of my first projects and the fun that can be had with jQuery.
